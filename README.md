Welcome, and thanks for downloading PallyScript!

Hey /r/rotmg-

I had this idea about using AHK to keep pallies buffed 24/7 *without any MP loss.* 
I'm relatively new to scripting and such, but threw this together as an idea, 
hoping someone would pick up on it and possibly even integrate it into their own RotMG script. 
It's just a basic timer set on 10s to hit space at the exact moment your buff ruuns out. 
In the future, I plan on adding different settings for different pets, etc. 
Video of the scrpt in action to come in the future.
