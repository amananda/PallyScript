PallyScript
===========
Welcome, and thanks for your interest in PallyScript!

from reddit.com:

Hey /r/rotmg-

I had this idea about using AHK to keep pallies buffed 24/7 *without any MP loss.* 
I'm relatively new to scripting and such, but threw this together as an idea, 
hoping someone would pick up on it and possibly even integrate it into their own RotMG script. 
It's just a basic timer set on 10s to hit space at the exact moment your buff runs out. 
In the future, I plan on adding different settings for different pets, etc. 
Video of the scrpt in action to come in the future.

Comment from /r/RotMG mod on controversiality of PallyScript:

Currently this script presses space bar every 10 seconds. There's hardly anything controversial 
or game-breaking about that. In fact, it's so simple and boring, it's hardly worth using.
There's no way for it to live up to the without any MP loss... as THAT would break the game.
